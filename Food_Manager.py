        This platform helps manage and analyze food donations to minimize wastage
        and ensure food reaches the people who need it most.  

        **Features you‚Äôll find here:**  
        - üîé *Search & Filter*: Explore available food listings by city, provider, food type, or meal type.  
        - üìä *SQL Queries*: Run powerful pre-defined queries to gain insights into providers, receivers, claims, and food availability.

        ### Why this project?  
        Food wastage is a pressing global issue. By managing food supply chains efficiently,  
        we can:  
        - Reduce hunger and food insecurity  
        - Support local communities and NGOs  
        - Build a more sustainable food ecosystem
